## Easy Behavior Tree

A very simple behavior tree implementation, including:

1. Basic behavior tree functions in C# but independent of any Unity Engine codes;

2. A behavior tree can run totally without a GameObject;

3. A behavior tree creator with Unity Editor in which binary format behavior tree files can be generated;

4. Types of nodes, node parameters and blackboard data can be easily extended;

5. Debugging system including logger interfaces and node info fomatters;
